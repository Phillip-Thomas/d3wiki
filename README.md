# D3tree


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.5.

It takes a D3.js collapsible tree, and breaks it down completely into an angular component. No more custom js or the need for Jquery. This tree then updates routing on node click event and that routing triggeres database retrieval of wikipedia information.
